      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      let copyPlayers
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      copyPlayers = players
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      players[4] = 'Mike'
      // now here is the problem!
      console.warn('copied looks like the original array!')

      console.warn('editing a copy makes original change too')
      console.log(players)
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      copyPlayers = players.slice()
      players.pop()
      console.log(players)
      console.log(copyPlayers)
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      copyPlayers = [].concat(players)
      players.pop()
      console.log(players)
      console.log(copyPlayers)
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      copyPlayers = [...players]
      players.pop()
      console.log(players)
      console.log(copyPlayers)
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      }

      // and think we make a copy:
      let copyPerson = person
      person.status = 'mia'
      console.group('naiive reference copy')
      console.log(copyPerson)
      console.log(person)
      console.groupEnd('naiive reference copy')
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      copyPerson = Object.defineProperties(
        {},
        Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(person)
      )

      copyPerson.status = 'alive'
      console.group('copy with descriptors')
      console.log(copyPerson)
      console.log(person)
      console.groupEnd('copy with descriptors')
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const copyPerson2 = { ...person }
      copyPerson2.status = 'deceased'
      console.group('obj spread')
      console.log(copyPerson)
      console.log(copyPerson2)
      console.log(person)
      console.groupEnd('obj spread')
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
